ThunderPy

This is a driver that controls the Dream Cheeky Thunder Missile Launcher.

Controls:
	for a timed action->	sudo ./thunderPyController.py [direction] [time(sec)]
	for an indefinite action-> sudo ./thunderPyController.py -c [direction]
*Remember that -c must be first flag and the direction must include flag
*	Sample: sudo ./thunderPyController.py -l 1
*	This would move left for 1 second

Directions:
	-l -left
	-r -right
	-d -down
	-u -up
*	-f -fire
	-s -stop

*I would call fire like: sudo ./thunderPyController.py -f
